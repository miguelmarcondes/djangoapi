# DJANGO REST API 

A project focused on syphoning data from FBI and INTERPOL API services, populating it in a private database and then displaying it to users with an API.

Developed using Django, Django Rest Framework, Python, Pandas, DRF Spectacular and Swagger UI.

# How to Run

The databases is stored with the project so there is no need to actually run the external API Requests.

* Be sure to install all the libraries defined on requirements.txt.

* Run command: python manage.py runserver

* Feel free to create a superuser to check the admin interface

* Browse through the api by the urls, for example, localhost/api/schema/docs/ gives you the documentation with the Swagger UI.
